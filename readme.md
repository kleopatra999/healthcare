# Healthcare API Research

This is an open healthcare API research project, trying to better what APIs exist as part of the healthcare space already, as well as help define what should be.

This research currently breaks down information in the following areas:

* Organizations - Profiling companies who have products, services, and healthcare APIs.
* People - People who are doing interesting things around healthcare APIs.
* Tools - Open source tools and specifications that are put to use in the healthcare sector.
* Building Blocks - Common building blocks of healthcare API, and their platforms.
* News - Healthcare API news that is curated from across the industry.

Everything that is publicly available at: http://healthcare.stack.network/

The research overview, and activities will live here in the raw Github repository, accessible via this projects README file.

If there are any specific topics, conversations, and research projects, we should create individual issues for them on the Github Issue management for this project. 

I have setup a spreadsheet for storing the information gathered, and will sync with the master service that publishes it here to the repository and website - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z6R1M0WZ_P6TPxEpROR5udDhjdS073svEGHzysPW4tw/edit#gid=1823777748

Working:

* [Profile CeCity](https://github.com/api-stack/healthcare/issues/2) - We should be profiling this company, adding to the spreadsheet, and adding any thoughts to the issue thread.
