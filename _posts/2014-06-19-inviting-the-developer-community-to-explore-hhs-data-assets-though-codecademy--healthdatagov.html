<p>In the early 2014, the Health Indicators Warehouse staff developed a series of short lessons for developers new to using Application Programming Interfaces (API) and to educate them about accessing data though the HIW’s web services.  An API is a defined set of programming instructions allowing web-based interaction between two systems and their previously separate databases. The open structure of an API allows users to have controlled access to data which will foster innovative uses.We have posted our basic API lessons to Codecademy.  Codecademy is an education company building, in their words, “the first truly net native education”, taking as inspiration the many ways the Internet has allowed people to rethink old ways of doing things and applying those lessons to teaching programming.</p>
