<p>Cigna, one of the worldâ€™s largest health services provider, now offers realtime health data through the Cigna Health API.The API enables developers to create applications with personalized data, share test applications, deploy production applications and more.Authorized developer partners gain access to two general bodies of data: individual services (personal data) and utility services (broad set of capabilities).Cigna is often narrowly thought of as a massive health insurance provider.However, InformationWeek named Cigna one of the top technology innovators of 2012.</p>
