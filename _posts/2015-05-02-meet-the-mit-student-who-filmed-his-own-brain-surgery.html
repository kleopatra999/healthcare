When MIT doctoral student Steven Keating got a terrifying diagnosis of brain cancer last year, he decided it was a perfect opportunity to conduct a science experiment â€” on himself.Last summer, the 26-year-old learned he had astrocytoma, a low-grade tumor in the left frontal lobe of his brain.In the months since, he has collected some 75 gigabytes of information: a 3D printout of his own brain, genetic sequencing data, microbiome sequencing data, his every CT scan and MRI, blood work, tumor pathology slides, angiograms, and copies of all of his health records.He also took his own stool samples during his cancer treatment in order to study how chemotherapy changed his gut flora.</p>
