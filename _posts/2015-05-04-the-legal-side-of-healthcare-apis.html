<p>I was taking a look at a new healthcare API recently, adding it to my stack, for deeper review at a later date.Whenever I add a company to my monitoring and review system, I go through the site to make sure they have some of the characteristics of a modern API.I am not interested in many of the APIs that I come across that are older web services, or just poorly done APIs.I want to make sure APIs have self-service registration, some web API characteristics, code libraries, support, and a minimum viable set of building blocks.The API I was looking at isÂ Validic, which bills itself as a Digital Health Platform.</p>
