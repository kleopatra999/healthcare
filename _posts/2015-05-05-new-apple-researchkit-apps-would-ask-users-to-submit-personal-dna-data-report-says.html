<p>Apple is collaborating with a couple of U.S.researcher facilities to create apps that gather and organize consumers’ DNA data, a new report says.The report, from MIT’s Technology Review, says the apps will “offer some iPhone owners the chance to get their DNA tested, many of them for the first time, according to people familiar with the plans.”
The new apps are based on Apple’s ResearchKit, a data-integration platform designed to collect infomartion from consumer devices and package it for health research use.</p>
