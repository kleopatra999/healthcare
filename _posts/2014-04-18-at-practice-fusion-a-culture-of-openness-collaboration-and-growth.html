<p>At Practice Fusion, we’re a tribe — a group of highly motivated individuals who band together to achieve something big.Our team has developed a mentality of openness — open to user feedback, to evolving our product, to fleshing out new ideas, to helping our community do more, better and faster.One of our core values is “embrace the team.” One example that really gets to the heart of this was our second round of certification for Meaningful Use, when our technology teams worked diligently to incorporate the long list of criteria needed for certification into the Practice Fusion platform.Every day during that initiative, groups from each department would visit the technology teams, delivering words of encouragement, visual support to make the goal, as well as delicious snacks for much-needed breaks.</p>
