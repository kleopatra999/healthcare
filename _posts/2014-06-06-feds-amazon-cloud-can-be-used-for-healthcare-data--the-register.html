<p>The US government will let healthcare insurers store sensitive data in the Amazon Web Services cloud, raising hackles among companies that had already bought on-premise kit.The US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced on a conference call last week that healthcare insurers will be able to feed healthcare data back to them via the Amazon Web Services cloud as well as on-premise servers, a CMS official confirmed to El Reg on Thursday.Insurers will be able to use the cloud to store and transmit risk adjustment and reinsurance data relating to people they have ensured under the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.Though this data is not as granular as individual health documents, it will still fall under various bits of privacy regulation.Therefore, in authorizing Amazon, CMS has blown away one of the main bits of counter-marketing that firms like to trot out against the cloud: strict regulations mean that data from industries such as healthcare will always need to stay on servers owned and operated by individual companies.</p>
