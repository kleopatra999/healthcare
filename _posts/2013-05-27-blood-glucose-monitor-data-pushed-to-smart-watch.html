<p>[Don] uses a Continuous Glucose Monitor to stay on top of his diabetes.It means carrying around an expensive and fragile device which acts as the readout.He’s an active guy and doesn’t want to destroy the thing while dirt biking or kick boxing so he’s been trying to use a TI Chronos smart watch as a display alternative.As you can see he has already made some headway.This image shows the watch displaying data from the device.</p>
