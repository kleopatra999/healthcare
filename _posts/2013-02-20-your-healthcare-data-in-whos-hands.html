<p>A week or so back I needed to put some stuff in storage as we’re moving house.Apparently my fine heirlooms are not conducive to selling the place, I was told.The storage facility I choose was pretty local and had the look of the scene from the end of the Raiders of the Lost Ark where the Ark of the Box 27B/6 you say?Im sure I passed it last Friday.Covenant is placed.</p>
