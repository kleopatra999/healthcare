<p>HHS Entrepreneurs is back!We are recruiting the best talent in America for the next cohort of HHS Entrepreneurs with six new projects.  HHS Entrepreneurs pairs some of our toughest program challenges with highly skilled, energetic, experts who are committed to public service to work on a project over a 12-month span.Through two prior rounds of HHS Entrepreneurs, we have seen some amazing all-star caliber talent come onboard and scrub in with teams of HHS employees to achieve some amazing results. Meet David Cartier, an expert in logistics who worked with the Health Resources Services Administration to modernize the organ transplant system, and Alan Viars who is currently working with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to transform and enhance the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (an awesomely vast database of all the nations doctors), and Kristann Orton who is working with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs to revamp a 20-year old internal clearance process to increase efficiency and reduce waste.</p>
