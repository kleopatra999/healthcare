<p>Apple is getting into the genetics business.A new report from Technology Review says that the company is collaborating with researchers for two different ResearchKit apps that will collect and study genetic data.In keeping with previous ResearchKit studies, Apple wont collect any of the samples or have access to the results, but Apples ResearchKit software will guide the process and coordinate subjects across studies.The move suggests a major new direction for the companys medical research software, and an exciting new avenue for genetic research.According to Technology Review, Apple is planning to announce the studies at WWDC in June.</p>
