<p>Kyle wrote a great post lastÂ  this week on APIs, specifically looking at Greenway vs.athena.He also gave a high-level overview of why RESTful APIs and the preference developers have to work with JSON as a data structure.I touched on APIs earlier this week as well when I wrote about digital omnivores and the use of the same service, Gmail for example, across different devices and using apps from different vendors to access the same data (Google Gmail).APIs are powerful and are leveraged to build many of the tools that we use today on mobile and web.</p>
