{% include JB/setup %}<p>While in Texas recently I took the opportunity to spend time with Practice Fusion, an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) vendor that I’ve covered previously.Practice Fusion is an interesting vendor, providing a free EMR service to physicians.It boasts that its solution is used to manage the records of over 31 million patients across the US through primarily small and mid-sized primary care practices.Practice Fusion must be on to something as they’ve managed to attract $38M worth of venture funding from some big names.Anyway, I was invited to attended a Practice Fusion event where I met with a number of practitioners using Practice Fusion to run their operations.</p>
