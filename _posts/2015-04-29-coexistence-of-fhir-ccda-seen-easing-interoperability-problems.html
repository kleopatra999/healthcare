<p>Despite the potential of Health Level Sevens Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) to help solve some of the challenges of interoperability, for the foreseeable future government and industry experts predict that FHIRan application programming interface (API) that leverages the latest web standardswill coexist side-by-side with the Consolidated-Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA).FHIR is particularly useful where youre looking to query and retrieve specific data elements, not just an entire clinical document, says Erica Galvez, interoperability and exchange portfolio manager for the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT, who is leading the agencys efforts to achieve nationwide interoperability.But, Galvez hastens to add that C-CDA and FHIR serve different purposes.Its really unfortunate to try and line-up C-CDA against FHIR and to do a comparison or a better than, she argues.Frankly, they will probably coexist for some timemaybe foreverif FHIR does continue down a successful trajectory.</p>
