<p>Next week I am participating in a webinar called Mobile Optimized Healthcare API Programs, from a technical perspective we’ll be looking at some interesting integration between Intel’s Security Gateway and Mashery.From a healthcare standpoint, the discussion looks at what new kinds of use cases are possible in this ecosystem.For as much hype that financial services and other sectors get vis a vis security, the healthcare security problem set really is harder than the rest.At the same time, there are dramatic benefits from enabling mobile integration for healthcare, it benefits your number one asset: you.Whether its Fit Bit, Nike+, or just healthcare pros with iPads, mobile is uniquely suited to health and wellness related applications.</p>
