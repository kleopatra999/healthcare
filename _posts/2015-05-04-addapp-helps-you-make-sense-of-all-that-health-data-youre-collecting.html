<p>There is a multitude of ways to track aspects of your health these days, but making sense of all the data you collect is tricky.Addapp is a new app that aims to help you do just that.Out now for iOS, Addapp gives plain English recommendations for action based on data from sources like Fitbit, Jawbone, Withings, Apple’s Health app, and even Foursquare and Uber.Once you’ve connected the services you use, you’ll start to get simple prompts based on correlations between the different data sources.I installed the app four days ago, feeding it my step count, distance traveled and heart rate from Apple Health, and my weight and body fat ratio from a Withings scale.</p>
