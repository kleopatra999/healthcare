<p>Healthcare is one of the slowest moving industries when it comes to technological innovation and modernization.Too many physician offices, hospitals and other healthcare organizations are using legacy electronic health record (EHR) systems that lack even the most basic modern functionality.Most of these legacy systems were not designed to be integrated with third-party applications, and many are built as silos not capable of communicating with other systems.Screenshots show the workflow between drchrono and QueueDr.Images provided by drchrono.</p>
