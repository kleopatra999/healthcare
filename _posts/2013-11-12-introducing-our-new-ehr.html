<p>In the next few months you’ll begin to see the results of two initiatives aimed at delivering a better EHR experience.First, we’re making all upcoming changes in your EHR in HTML, which will allow us to make faster updates so we can rapidly act on your feature requests.Once we’ve fully moved to HTML from the current Flex code, you’ll be able to access your new EHR from any device, including iPads and tablets.Second, we’re making across-the-board design and usability improvements in the new EHR, based largely on your feedback.As we release updated features you’ll see a more modern look and feel.</p>
