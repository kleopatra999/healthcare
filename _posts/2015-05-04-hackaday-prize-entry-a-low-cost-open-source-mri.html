This low cost magnetic resonance imager isn’t [Peter]’s first attempt at medical imaging, and it isn’t his first project for the Hackaday Prize, either.He’s already built a CT scanner using a barium check source and a CCD marketed as a high-energy particle detector.His Hackaday Prize entry last year, an Open Source Science Tricorder with enough sensors to make [Spock] jealous, ended up winning fourth place.[Peter]’s MRI scanner addresses some of the shortcomings of his Open Source CT scanner.</p>
