<p>This week has been a crazy week for our team (in a good way of course)!From sponsoring Indianapolis’ first ever civic hackathon (IndyCivicHack) to several presentations at the fifth annual HealthDataPalooza, we have been all about community building and open data this week.One of our focuses throughout it all has been on the openFDA API launch.Our team has had the fortunate opportunity to be part the API’s beta which included working collaboratively with the openFDA team providing them with feedback on the API and building initial solutions on top of it.The experience has been simply awesome!</p>
