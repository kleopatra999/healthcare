<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that Practice Fusion has acquired Ringadoc, an innovator of next-generation patient-doctor communication tools.This acquisition will serve as a springboard for Practice Fusion’s entry into the telemedicine market, allowing us to integrate Ringadoc’s service and technology into the nation’s largest cloud-based electronic health record (EHR) platform.Ringadoc offers an automated, cloud-based answering service that allows doctors to instantly access and respond to after-hours messages via web browser, Android or Apple mobile application, for a starting price of $69 per provider.In addition, Ringadoc increases office efficiency by giving doctors the ability to triage patient calls, centralize communications, and manage their patient population.Stay tuned over the next few months for updates on how we’ll be rolling out these new features to the Practice Fusion community.</p>
