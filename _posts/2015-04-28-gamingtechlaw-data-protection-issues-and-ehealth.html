<p>Medical devices and new technologies are becoming more and more linked one to the other in order to allow medical practitioners to continuously monitor their patients’ health conditions through eHealth remote patient management systems connected to cloud databases contributing to the growth of the Internet of Things. However such technologies lead to relevant legal issues including data protection issues.Medical device companies should assess the legal implications of technologies allowing practitioners to review the status of their patients in real time through devices that are connected to cloud databases, which can be accessed not only to review patients’ health conditions, but also to perform clinical trials. These tools can be implanted directly in the body, as is the case with biostamp electronic tattoos and insertable cardiac monitors, which have contributed to the growth of the so-called ‘wearable technologies’ sector along with smart watches, fitness bands and smart glasses.These new technologies trigger privacy issues because of the large amount of sensitive data on patients’ health conditions that is collected and then transferred to a database accessible by practitioners.</p>
