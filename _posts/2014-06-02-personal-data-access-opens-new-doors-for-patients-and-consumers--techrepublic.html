<p>If, as a 2011 report from the World Economic Forum (PDF) put it, personal data is a new asset class, its not one that has received a great deal of attention from your local newspaper, banker, principal, or doctor.There are changes afoot in multiple sectors that are starting to give consumers and patients more access to their own data, which means that both those entrusted with its stewardship and those who want it would benefit from paying attention to this trend.  As people gain access to their own data from hospitals, banks, energy companies, schools, and technology companies, it stands to drive market transparency and empower consumers.In the optimal scenario, giving people access to their own data—or data about them, like a credit report—is one of the best applications of data for the public good.From a veteran suffering from PTSD who needs access to his personal health record at a clinic to a student who needs to download her tax transcript online to apply for loans to a family that wants to track their home energy usage, personal data can enable people to gain more understanding about their lives and act to improve them if it is disclosed to them in machine-readable forms.</p>
