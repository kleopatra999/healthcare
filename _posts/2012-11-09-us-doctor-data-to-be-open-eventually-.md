{% include JB/setup %}<p>The company behind the project is NotOnly Dev, a Health IT software incubator who describe themselves as a “not-only-for-profit” company.Earlier this year they released a Doctor Social Graph, which displays the connections between doctors, hospitals and other healthcare organizations in the US.The dataset used is billed as “THE data set that any academic, scientist, or health policy junkie could ever want to conduct almost any study.”
  Our goal is to empower the patient, make the system transparent and accountable, and release this data to the people who can use it to revitalize our health system.They’d acquired the data for that project through a whole load of FOI requests which they gradually stitched together – but to take the project to the next level they wanted to buy the State Medical Board report data for every state in the US.</p>
