<p>HIMSS Analytics conducted a survey of nurses, uncovering what they like (and what they don’t like) about electronic health records (EHRs).One of the results shocked me: about 15% nurses wanted to go back to paper-based medical records, and another 15% said they weren’t sure if they’d go back or not.I flashed back to my experience as a pediatric oncology nurse on the night shift.For example, when a patient’s fluid intake and output didn’t match up, I had to figure out if it was a miscalculation.I could spend 90 minutes poring over a spreadsheet trying to find the math error.</p>
