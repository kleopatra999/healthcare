<p>IBM Watson Health is collaborating with Epic and Mayo Clinic to advance patient health by applying the cognitive computing capabilities of Watson to EHRs.As Watson’s capabilities are applied to EHRs, patients and providers benefit from more rapid and thorough analysis of the medical factors that could impact an individual’s health and wellness.For Epic, interoperability with Watson will enable these institutions to apply the cognitive capabilities of Watson to these records through secure, cloud-based Watson services, providing greater clinical insight to help personalize healthcare.Epic currently has more than 350 customers and exchanges more than 80 million medical records in the last 12 months, both within and outside the Epic community. 
Together, Watson and Epic software could be used to develop patient treatment protocols, personalize patient management for chronic conditions, and intelligently assist doctors and nurses by providing relevant evidence from the worldwide body of medical knowledge, putting new insight into the hands of clinicians.</p>
