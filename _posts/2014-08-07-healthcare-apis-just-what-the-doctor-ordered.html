<p>Although it has received limited media coverage, each day, organizations are  leveraging APIs to reimagine healthcare.The healthcare industry’s interest in APIs arose from successful web 2.0 mashups that propelled data exchanges in other verticals, and it has further grown in the wake of early-adopter healthcare companies that sought to integrate cloud services with on-premise systems.Today, healthcare providers are using APIs to extend the point of care beyond the walls of the hospital, while health insurance companies are moving from passive payers of claims to active managers of their policyholders lifestyles.As the healthcare industry embraces new technologies that have increased the efficiency of other verticals and made them more responsive, it has also sought ways to digitize data and make it easier to consume.</p>
