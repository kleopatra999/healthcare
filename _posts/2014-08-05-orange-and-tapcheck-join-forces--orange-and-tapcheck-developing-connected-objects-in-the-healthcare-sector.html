<p>TAPcheck® – a member of the Plus Prevention Group – specialises in the production and distribution of healthcare and wellness products.Thanks to the integration and hosting of its healthcare and wellness applications on the Orange Business Services Flexible Computing platform, TAPcheck® is now in a position to make its health products connected.This partnership agreement was implemented to allow TAPcheck® to market an end-to-end service.The  collaboration, which will initially be restricted to Europe, will  consist of marketing equipment such as connected glucose monitors,  tensiometers, thermometers, scales and activity sensors to hospitals.These  connected objects will allow healthcare professionals to access  patients’ personal data, as well as the history of all data uploaded  during medical aftercare, easily and in real time via an application.</p>
